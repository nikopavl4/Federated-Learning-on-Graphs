# Federated-Learning-on-Graphs
Codes about Graph Neural Networks and Federated Learning

## Simple Federated GCN
A very first example of a federated setup using a Graph Convolution Network.
We use ENZYMES dataset that contains 600 graphs and 6 labels.

**Centralized Experiment**
Training Set: 500 graphs
Testing Set: 100 graphs

Results after 70 epochs of training:
